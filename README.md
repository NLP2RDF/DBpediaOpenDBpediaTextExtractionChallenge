## DBpedia Open Text Extraction Challenge - a never ending knowledge acquisition spiral

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/NLP2RDF/DBpediaOpenDBpediaTextExtractionChallenge](https://badges.gitter.im/NLP2RDF/DBpediaOpenDBpediaTextExtractionChallenge.svg)](https://gitter.im/NLP2RDF/DBpediaOpenDBpediaTextExtractionChallenge?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

The DBpedia Open Text Extraction Challenge differs significantly from other challenges in the language technology and other areas in that it is not a one time call, but a continuous growing and expanding challenge with the focus to sustainably advance the state of the art and transcend boundaries in a systematic way. The DBpedia Association and the people behind this challenge are committed to provide the necessary infrastructure and drive the challenge for an indefinite time as well as potentially extend the challenge beyond Wikipedia. 

We provide the extracted and cleaned full text for all Wikipedia articles from 9 different languages in regular intervals for download and as Docker in the machine readable NIF-RDF format. Challenge participants are asked to wrap their NLP and extraction engines in Docker images and submit them to us. We will run participantsâ€™ tools in regular intervals in order to extract: 
Facts, relations, events, terminology, ontologies as RDF triples (Triple track)
Useful NLP annotations such as pos-tags, dependencies, co-reference (Annotation track)
